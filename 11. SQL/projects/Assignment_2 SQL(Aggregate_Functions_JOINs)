1.How many tracks does each album have? Your solution should include Album id and its number of tracks sorted from highest to lowest.

SELECT albums.AlbumId, COUNT(tracks.TrackId)
FROM tracks 
INNER JOIN albums ON albums.AlbumId = tracks.AlbumId
GROUP BY albums.AlbumId
ORDER BY tracks.TrackId DESC;


2.Find the album title of the tracks. Your solution should include track name and its album title.

SELECT tracks.Name, albums.Title
FROM tracks
INNER JOIN albums
ON albums.AlbumId=tracks.AlbumId;


3.Find the minimum duration of the track in each album. Your solution should include album id, album title and duration of the track sorted from highest to lowest.

SELECT albums.AlbumId, MIN(Milliseconds), albums.Title
FROM tracks INNER JOIN albums on  albums.AlbumId=tracks.AlbumId
GROUP BY albums.AlbumId
ORDER by MIN(Milliseconds) DESC;


4.Find the total duration of each album. Your solution should include album id, album title and its total duration sorted from highest to lowest.

SELECT albums.AlbumId, SUM(Milliseconds), albums.Title
FROM tracks INNER JOIN albums ON albums.AlbumId = tracks.AlbumId
GROUP BY albums.AlbumId
ORDER BY SUM(Milliseconds) DESC;


5.Based on the previous question, find the albums whose total duration is higher than 70 minutes. Your solution should include album title and total duration. 70*60*100=420000

SELECT *
FROM
	(SELECT albums.AlbumId, SUM(Milliseconds) AS Total_duration, albums.Title
	FROM tracks INNER JOIN albums ON albums.AlbumId = tracks.AlbumId
	GROUP BY albums.AlbumId
	ORDER BY Total_duration DESC)
WHERE Total_duration >420000;

SELECT a.Title AS Album_Title, SUM(t.Milliseconds) AS Duration
  FROM albums a INNER JOIN tracks t ON a.AlbumId = t.AlbumId
  GROUP BY Album_Title
  HAVING Duration > 4200000
  ORDER BY Duration DESC;
